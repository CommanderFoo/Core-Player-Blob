Well hello there.

So recently the amazing Tobs done an Obby stream, and I joined in to try some of the games.  Something I noticed from a lot of 
obbys is when you are jumping from platform to plaform, or being bounced high into the sky, it was hard to see where you were
going to land.  To me it was frustrating, especially for a few of the games where you needed to be quite precise with your jumps.

So I created a blob component for the player that acts as a shadow at the players feet.  This blob will continue to show on 
whatever surface is below the player so thay can see where they are about to land.  It's a simple thing but very useful.

The component is very easy to use.  Just drag and drop the template "Player Blob" into your hierarchy.  When entering play mode
you should see a blob (aka circle) at the players feet.

I included an example as well with bouncers so you can test it out.

There is some options so you can play with the max distance, color etc.

No fancy documentation this time as it's a very simple component.
